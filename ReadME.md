# Simple To-Do App with React and Node.js

This is a simple To-Do application built with a React frontend and a Node.js backend, designed to help me learn and explore Docker for containerizing full-stack applications. The project uses Docker and Docker Compose to run the frontend and backend as separate services, demonstrating a basic multi-container application.

## üìù Features

- **Frontend**: Built with React, allowing users to add and view tasks in a clean UI.
- **Backend**: Built with Node.js and Express, handling task management with a simple REST API.
- **Dockerized**: Both the frontend and backend are containerized using Docker, making the application easy to run and manage.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine.

### Installation and Running the Application

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-todo-app.git
   cd simple-todo-app
   ```
````

2. **Build the Docker containers:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

4. **Access the application:**

   - Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Backend: Runs on port 5000

## üê≥ Understanding the Docker Setup

### Backend (`/backend/Dockerfile`)

The backend is a Node.js application using Express for handling REST API requests. Here's a breakdown of the Dockerfile:

- **Base Image**: `node:18-alpine` for a lightweight Node.js environment.
- **Working Directory**: Sets `/app` as the working directory inside the container.
- **Dependencies**: Installs dependencies defined in `package.json`.
- **Copy Source Code**: Copies the backend source code into the container.
- **Expose Port 5000**: Exposes the backend to port 5000.
- **Start Command**: Runs `node server.js` to start the server.

### Frontend (`/frontend/Dockerfile`)

The frontend is a React application built and served using `serve`. Key steps in the Dockerfile include:

- **Base Image**: `node:18-alpine` for a small Node.js environment.
- **Build Step**: Builds the React application for production.
- **Serving**: Uses `serve` to run the built files.
- **Expose Port 3000**: Exposes the frontend to port 3000.

### Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml`)

Docker Compose is used to orchestrate both the backend and frontend containers:

- **Backend Service**: Runs the Node.js server on port 5000.
- **Frontend Service**: Runs the React frontend on port 3000 and depends on the backend service.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By creating this project, I'm learning to:

- **Containerize Applications**: Understand the process of creating Dockerfiles for different services.
- **Use Docker Compose**: Manage multi-container applications efficiently.
- **Expose and Link Services**: Connect frontend and backend services within a Docker network.
- **Explore Best Practices**: Follow best practices for setting up and managing Dockerized environments.

## üìö What I've Learned So Far

- **Docker Basics**: Understanding images, containers, and Dockerfiles.
- **Container Networking**: How services communicate within Docker.
- **Efficiency**: Building and running multi-container applications seamlessly with Docker Compose.
